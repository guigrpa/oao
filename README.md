# oao :package: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guigrpa/oao.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guigrpa/oao) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/guigrpa/oao/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/guigrpa/oao?branch=master) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/oao.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oao)

![oao all --parallel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/oao/master/docs/parallel.gif)

A Yarn-based, opinionated monorepo management tool.


## Why? :sparkles:

* Works with **yarn**, hence (relatively) **fast!**.
* **Simple to use** and extend (hope so!).
* Provides a number of monorepo **workflow enhancers**: installing all dependencies, adding/removing/upgrading sub-package dependencies, validating version numbers, determining updated sub-packages, publishing everything at once, updating the changelog, etc.
* Supports **yarn workspaces**, optimising the monorepo dependency tree as a whole and simplifying bootstrap as well as dependency add/upgrade/remove.
* **Prevents some typical publish errors** (using a non-master branch, uncommitted/non-pulled changes).
* Runs a command or `package.json` script on all sub-packages, **serially or in parallel**, optionally following the inverse dependency tree.
* Provides an easy-to-read, **detailed status overview**.
* Support for **non-monorepo publishing**: benefit from *oao*'s pre-publish checks, tagging, version selection, changelog updates, etc. also in your single-package, non-monorepos.


## Assumptions :thought_balloon:

As stated in the tagline, *oao* is somewhat opinionated and makes the following assumptions on your monorepo:

* It uses a **synchronized versioning scheme**. In other words: a *master version* is configured in the root-level `package.json`, and sub-packages will be in sync with that version (whenever they are updated). Some sub-packages can be *left behind* version-wise if they're not updated, but they'll jump to the master version when they get some love.
* You use **git** for version control and have already initialised your repo.
* **Git tags** are used for releases (and *only* for releases), and follow semver: `v0.1.3`, `v2.3.5`, `v3.1.0-rc.1` and so on.
* Some sub-packages may be public, others private (flagged `"private": true` in `package.json`). OK, *no assumption here*: rest assured that no private sub-packages will be published by mistake.


## Installation

If *yarn* is not installed in your system, please [install it first](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). If you want to use [**yarn workspaces**](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/) (available since yarn 0.28), enable them by running `yarn config set workspaces-experimental true` and configure the following in your monorepo package.json (replace the glob patterns for your subpackages/workspaces as needed):

```
"workspaces": [
  'packages/*'
]
```

Add **oao** to your development dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn add oao --dev
```

## Main commands

In recent versions of npm, remember that you can run oao commands conveniently with the `npx` tool:

```sh
$ npx oao bootstrap
$ npx oao add my-subpackage my-new-dependency --dev
$ npx oao publish
```

This uses the local oao package inside your monorepo.


### `oao status`

Provides lots of information on the git repo (current branch, last tag, uncommitted/unpulled changes) and subpackage status (version, private flag, changes since last tag, dependencies).

![oao status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/oao/master/docs/status.png)


### `oao bootstrap`

Installs all sub-package dependencies using **yarn**. External dependencies are installed normally, whereas those belonging to the monorepo itself (and custom links specified with the `--link` option) are `yarn link`ed. Note that dependencies may end up in different places depending on whether you use [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/) or not (see above).

Development-only dependencies can be skipped by enabling the `--production` option, or setting the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production`. Other flags that are passed through to `yarn install` include `--frozen-lockfile`, `--pure-lockfile` and `--no-lockfile`.


### `oao clean`

Removes `node_modules` directories from all sub-packages, as well as from the root package.


### `oao add <sub-package> <deps...>`

Adds one or several dependencies to a sub-package. For external dependencies, it passes through [`yarn add`'s flags](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add). Internal dependencies are linked. Examples:

```sh
$ oao add subpackage-1 jest --dev
$ oao add subpackage-2 react subpackage-1 --exact
```


### `oao remove <sub-package> <deps...>`

Removes one or several dependencies from a sub-package. Examples:

```sh
$ oao remove subpackage-1 jest
$ oao remove subpackage-2 react subpackage-1
```


### `oao upgrade <sub-package> [deps...]`

Upgrade one/several/all dependencies of a sub-package. For external dependencies, it will download the upgraded dependency using yarn. For internal dependencies, it will just update the sub-package's `package.json` file. Examples:

```sh
$ oao upgrade subpackage-1 jest@18.0.1
$ oao upgrade subpackage-2 react subpackage-1@3.1.2
$ oao upgrade subpackage-3
```


### `oao outdated`

Runs `yarn outdated` on all sub-packages, as well as the root package.


### `oao prepublish`

Carries out a number of chores that are needed before publishing:

* Checks that all version numbers are valid and <= the master version.
* Copies `<root>/README.md` to the *main* sub-package (the one having the same name as the monorepo).
* Copies `<root>/README-LINK.md` to all other sub-packages.
* Copies several fields from the root `package.json` to all other `package.json` files: `description`, `keywords`, `author`, `license`, `homepage`, `bugs`, `repository`.


### `oao publish`

Carries out a number of steps:

* Asks the user for confirmation that it has *built* all sub-packages for publishing (using something like `yarn build`).
* Performs a number of checks:
    - The current branch should be `master`.
    - No uncommitted changes should remain in the working directory.
    - No unpulled changes should remain.
* Determines which sub-packages need publishing (those which have changed with respect to the last tagged version).
* Asks the user for an incremented master version (major, minor, patch or pre-release major), that will be used for the root package as well as all updated sub-packages.
* Asks the user for final confirmation before publishing.
* Updates versions in `package.json` files, commits the updates, adds a tag and pushes all the changes.
* Publishes updated sub-packages.

There are lots of custom options for `oao publish`. Chances are, you can disable each one of the previous steps by means of one of those options. Check them all with `oao publish --help`.

**Note: There is a problem when running `oao publish` as a script run with `yarn`. As a workaround, either run `oao publish` manually from the command line, or put it in a script and run it with `npm`, not `yarn`.**

### `oao all <command>`

Executes the specified command on all sub-packages (private ones included), with the sub-package's root as *current working directory*. Examples:

```sh
$ oao all ls
$ oao all "ls -al"
$ oao all "yarn run compile"
$ oao all --tree "yarn run compile"
```

By default, `oao all` runs sequentially. Sometimes you must run commands in parallel, for example when you want to compile all sub-packages with a *watch* option:

```sh
$ oao all "yarn run compileWatch" --parallel
```

**Note: some terminals may have problems with parallel logs (based on [terminal-kit](https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit)). If you experience issues, use the `--no-parallel-logs` flag. If you're using the default terminal or Hyper on OS X or Windows, you should be fine.**

Use `--tree` if you want to follow the inverse dependency tree (starting from the tree leaves).

You can also pass extra arguments to the command separating them with a `--`: `oao all ls -- -al` is equivalent to `oao all 'ls -al'`. This can be useful for adding extra commands to scripts in `package.json`.

### `oao run-script <script>`

Similar to `oao all <command>`, it executes the specified (package) script on all sub-packages. Missing scripts will be skipped. Examples:

```sh
$ oao run-script start
$ oao run-script start --parallel
$ oao run-script start --tree
```

By default, `oao run-script` runs sequentially. Use `--parallel` to run the scripts in parallel, and `--tree` if you want to follow the inverse dependency tree (starting from the tree leaves).

## Why *oao*? :sunglasses:

Basically, many other names I could come up with were either too boring (*mono-repo*), or already taken. *oao* stands for *one and only* :grimacing:, which is a reference to the individual nature of monorepos, as well as a beautiful song by Adele. Yes, I agree it's far-fetched, but extremely short and convenient!
